    "- Write and execute your code in the browser\n",
    "- Display the results of your analysis in a table or visualization\n",
    "- Interweave your code with narrative to give it context or explain your thought process\n",

    "\n",
    "### Code Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Code cells consist of code snippets and the program can run and execute the code. You'll see a `[ ]:` to the left of the cell. This will tell you that the cell has code to run. After you've run the cell, you'll see a number `[1]:` that gives what order the cell was run in.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code in a cell block, you can do one of the following:\n",
    "- press shift + enter, or\n",
    "- click the <i class=\"fa-step-forward fa\"></i> run button in the toobar at the top of the page\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook will remember the code that you ran earlier and save any variables you created. If you want to re-run a cell, you can do so. Or you can re-run the whole notebook from the beginning. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Markdown Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells are where you add your narrative (like this one). Markdown is a lightweight syntax for formatting your text. Some digital humanists prefer to take notes in a text editor using Markdown. You can learn more about writing in Markdown here: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### If you get stuck\n",
